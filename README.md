# 9.SQL-challenge

Module 9 Challenge - Research Project of Employee Database

This challenge consisted of 3 components:

- Data Modeling
Using QuickDBD, I sketched an Entity Relationship Diagram of the CSV files I was provided with.

- Data Engineering
I created a table schema for each of the six CSV files, specifying the data types, primary keys, and foreign keys. Thereafter, I imported each CSV file into its corresponding SQL table. This can be found in the table_schemata.sql file in the EmployeeSQL folder.

- Data Analysis
My data analysis can be found in the queries.sql file in the EmployeeSQL folder.
